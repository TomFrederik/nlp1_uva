But this time, next to completing the notebook, **you are expected to write a four-page scientific report with your findings**. Please still submit the notebook together with your scientific report so that we can reproduce your experiments. (Note: if you find it useful, you can split this notebook into multiple notebooks. If you do so, keep it mind that it should be possible for your TAs to reproduce the entire content of the notebooks without having to ask for clarifications or to copy and paste functions from one sub-notebook to another.)\n",

    "In Practical 1, a review consisted of several sentences, and we had one sentiment score for the whole review. Now, a review consists of a single sentence, and we have a sentiment score for each node in the binary tree that makes up the sentence, including the root node (i.e., we still have an overall sentiment score for the entire review). We will look at an example below.\n",

    "Since we now use pre-trained word embeddings, we need to create a new vocabulary. \n",
    "This is because of two reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We do not have pre-trained word embeddings for all words in our SST training set, and we do not want words in our vocabulary for which we have no word embeddings.\n",
    "2. We should be able to look up the pre-trained word embedding for words in the validation and test set, even if these words are unseen in training. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, create a new vocabulary object `v` based on the word set of pre-trained embeddings, and load the corresponding embeddings into a list `vectors`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The vocabulary `v` should consist of:\n",
    " - a  `<unk>` token at position 0,\n",
    " - a  `<pad>` token at position 1, \n",
    " - and then all words in the pre-trained embedding set.\n",
    " \n",

    "#### Dropout\n",
    "\n",
    "Data sparsity and a small data set can cause *overfitting*. This is a phenomenom that is very likely to occur when training strong and expressive models, like LSTMs, on small data. In practice, if your model overfits, this means that it will be very good at predicting (or \"remembering\") the sentiment of the training set, but unable to generalise to new, unseen data in the test set. This is undesirable and one technique to mitigate this issue is *dropout*. \n",
    "\n",
    "A dropout layer is defined by the following formula, which can be applied, for example, to a linear layer:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text{tanh}(W(\\mathbf{h}\\odot \\mathbf{d}) + \\mathbf{b})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\mathbf{d} \\in \\{0, 1\\}^n$, with $d_j \\sim \\text{Bernoulli}(p)$, \n",
    "\n",
    "These formula simply means that we *drop* certain parameters during training (by setting them to zero). Which parameters we drop is stochastically determined by a Bernoulli distribution and the probability of each parameter being dropped is set to $p = 0.5$ in our experiments (see the previous cell of code where we define our output layer). A dropout layer can be applied at many different places in our models. This technique helps against the undesirable effect that a model relies on single parameters for prediction (e.g. if $h^{\\prime}_j$ is large, always predict positive). If we use dropout, the model needs to learn to rely on different parameters, which is desirable to obtain better generalisation to unseen data."

    "Make sure you cover at least the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- How important is word order for this task?\n",
    "- Does the tree structure help to get a better accuracy?\n",
    "- How does performance depend on the sentence length? Compare the various models. Is there a model that does better on longer sentences? If so, why?\n",
    "- Do you get better performance if you supervise the sentiment **at each node in the tree**? You can extract more training examples by treating every node in each tree as a separate tree. You will need to write a function that extracts all subtrees given a treestring. \n",
    "    - Warning: NLTK's Tree function seems to result in invalid trees in some cases, so be careful if you want to parse the string to a tree structure before extraction the phrases.\n",
    "\n",
    "**To obtain a full grade, you should conduct further investigations.** For example, you can also investigate the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- When making a wrong prediction, can you figure out at what point in the tree (sentence) the model fails? You can make a prediction at each node to investigate.\n",
    "- How does N-ary Tree LSTM compare to the Child-Sum Tree LSTM? \n",

The validation dataset is used for finding the best model over iterations, but the accuracy you report should be on the test dataset.\n",

    "Your report needs to be written in LaTeX. You are required to use the ACL 2020 template which you can download from or edit directly on [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/instructions-for-acl-2018-proceedings/xzmhqgnmkppc). Make sure your names and student numbers are visible at the top. (Tip: you need to uncomment `\\aclfinalcopy`).\n",
    "You can find some general tips about writing a research paper [here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/academic-program/write-great-research-paper/), but note that you need to make your own judgment about what is appropriate for this project. \n",
    "\n",
    "We expect you to use the following structure:\n",
    "1. Introduction (~1 page) - describe the problem, your research questions and goals, a summary of your findings and contributions. Please cite related work (models, data set) as part of your introduction here, since this is a short paper.\n",
    "    - Introduce the task and the main goal\n",
    "    - Clear research questions\n",
    "    - Motivating the importance of the questions and explaining the expectations\n",
    "    - How are these addressed or not addressed in the literature\n",
    "    - What is your approach\n",
    "    - Short summary of your findings\n",
    "2. Background (~1/2-1 page) -\n",
    "cover the main techniques (\"building blocks\") used in your project (e.g. word embeddings, LSTM, Tree-LSTM) and intuitions behind them. Be accurate and concise.\n",
    "    - How each technique that you use works (don't just copy the formulas)\n",
    "    - The relation between the techniques\n",
    "3. Models (~1/2 page) - Cover the models that you used.\n",
    "    - The architecture of the final models (How do you use LSTM or Tree-LSTM for the sentiment classification task? What layers do you have, how do you do classification? What is your loss function?)\n",
    "4. Experiments (~1/2 page) - Describe your experimental setup. The information here should allow someone else to reproduce your experiments. Describe how you evaluate the models.\n",
    "    - Explain the task and the data\n",
    "    - Training the models (model, data, parameters and hyper parameters if the models, training algorithms, what supervision signals you use, etc.)\n",
    "    - Evaluation (e.g. metrics)\n",
    "5. Results and Analysis (~1 page). Go over the results and analyse your findings.\n",
    "    - Answer each of the research questions you raised in the introduction.\n",
    "    - Plots and figures highlighting interesting patterns\n",
    "    - What are the factors that make model A better than model B in task C? Investigate to prove their effect!\n",
    "6. Conclusion (~1/4 page). The main conclusions of your experiments.\n",
    "    - What have you learned from you experiments? How does it relate to what is already known in the literature?\n",
    "    - Were the results as expected? Any surprising results? Why?\n",
    "    - Based on what you learned what would you suggest doing next?\n",

    "General Tips:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Math notation – define each variable (either in running text, or in a pseudo-legenda after or before the equation).\n",
    "- Define technical terminology you need.\n",
    "- Avoid colloquial language – everything can be said in a scientific-sounding way.\n",
    "- Avoid lengthy sentences, stay to the point.\n",
    "- Do not spend space on \"obvious\" things.\n",
    "- Do not go over the page limit. (We will deduct points for that.)\n",
    "- The page limit is 4 pages excluding references and appendix. There is no strict limit to references and appendix. However, the report needs to remain fully self-contained: the appendix should only include content that is not necessary to understand your work. For example, preprocessing decisions, model parameters, pseudocode, sample system inputs/outputs, and other details that are necessary for the exact replication of your work can be put into the appendix. However, \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "An ideal report:\n",
    "- Precise, scientific-sounding, technical, to the point \n",
    "  - Little general “waffle”/chit-chat\n",
    "- Not boring – because you don’t explain obvious things too much\n",
    "- Efficient delivery of (only) the facts that we need to know to understand/reimplement\n",
    "- Results visually well-presented and described with the correct priority of importance of sub-results\n",
    "- Insightful analysis – speculation should connect to something interesting and not be too much; the reader “learns something new”\n",
    "- No typos, no colloquialisms – well-considered language\n",
    "- This normally means several re-draftings (re-orderings of information)\n"
